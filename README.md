This is a pokedex project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! It was developed during a [DIO](https://www.dio.me/) course with the purpose of practicing the concepts learned about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and API usage in a fun and engaging way.

### ‚úîÔ∏è Completed

The project uses the following APIs: ***[Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/), which provides Pok√©mon data, and [Pokemon.com](https://www.pokemon.com/br/), which supplies the images***. JavaScript fetches the Pok√©mon data from the APIs and uses HTML and CSS to automatically generate individual Pok√©mon cards.

### üí≠ Future plans

Implement detail pages for each Pok√©mon. When clicking on a specific Pok√©mon, a profile with detailed information will open.
